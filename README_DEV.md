## üß± Core Modules

### `hook_ai_parser.py`
Takes a raw prompt like:

```text
"Fly from NYC to Tokyo in April. I want cherry blossoms and budget hotels."
```

Outputs structured JSON:

```json
{
  "origin": "NYC",
  "destination": "Tokyo",
  "dates": ["2025-04-01", "2025-04-10"],
  "preferences": ["cherry blossoms", "budget hotels"]
}
```

---

### `generate_itinerary.py`
Generates an HTML trip view from the parsed JSON above. Can be plugged into PDF or email output modules.

---

### `utils/token_tracker.py`
Tracks TOL tokens earned by contributors. Add real wallet addresses or user IDs later.
